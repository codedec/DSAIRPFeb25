# Performance Metrics

- Classifcation
    - TP, TN, FP, FN
    - Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (Total)
    - Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
    - Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
    - F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

- Regression
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared difference.
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE.
    - R-squared (Δ²): Proportion of variance explained by the model.
    - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Percentage-based error.
