Descriptive statistics

Measures of central tendency

Mean:

Mode: Value that appears most frequently in a data set. The mode is the highest bar in a bar chart.

Median: 
 
Percentile: Percentage of values lesser than a threshold

Quartiles: Q1,Q2,Q3
Q2-central quartile(median),50th percentile
Q1-lower quartile The 25th percentile (bottom 25% of data).
Q3-Upper quartile The 75th percentile (top 75% of data)

Interquartile range(Q3-Q1)(IQR) : a measure of statistical dispersion, showing the spread of the middle 50% of a dataset. It helps identify outliers and understand variability.

Finding outliers using Quartiles
Lower bound(Q1 - 1.5*IQR)
Upper bound(Q3 +  1.5*IQR)
Outliers: values lower than LB or higher than HB

Measures of dispersion
- Range

-Variance (spread)

-Standard deviation

-Confidence Interval(CI)

Correlation coefficient(-1 to 1)
-Pearson correlation coefficient
-Sphearman's rank correlation

Scatter plot -> plotted Based on correlations

Histograms- Frequency/relative frequency

Box plot
-shows median(Q2),Q1,Q3, lower bound, upper bound, outliers

Normalization
 Z score(used for standardization)

Central Tendency in statistics

 Skewness

Negatively skewed
Normal
Positively skewed

Kurtosis
